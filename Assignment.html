            <p><span>This semester you have to program a simple game (othello) in python3 (see here&nbsp;<u><a

            </p>
            <p><span>The following list under&nbsp;<i>Assignment tasks</i>&nbsp;gives you instructions to create step by step (starting by 1 you should complete each task one by one) a playable game. We are giving you&nbsp;<span><u><a

            <p></p>
            <ul>The game has to be written in python3 in one single .py file. You are not allowed to execute other files
                or use packages within your code (basic python).</li>Submission: done in TeachCenter by &gt;&gt;latest&lt;&lt;

                <li>Code copied from the internet is generally not allowed and should not be required.&nbsp;<span
                        style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">If you really have to include some foreign code, make it clearly visible which lines are from whatever source.</span>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Let’s start with a stone</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Look at the code provided and make yourself familiar.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Create a function to set a stone to one field.</li>
                    <li><span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">Print the updated board to the console.</span><br></li>
                </ol>
                <li><b>It’s your turn - keyboard time</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>At this point of the assignment we want to be able to play the game with our keyboard. The game
                        should be played one player after one, so starting by asking where to put the first black stone,
                        print the whole field to the console accordingly, asking where to put the first white, and so
                        on.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <li>Coordinates are defined by row (A-H)[only upper case]&nbsp;and column (0-7), e.g. A0.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><code>PROMPT_PLAYER_1</code> and&nbsp;<code>PROMPT_PLAYER_2</code> are shown on a rotating basis
                        depending on the current player. (see screenshots at the end of the page)&nbsp;
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <li><b>Error detection and handling - What can go wrong?:</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Detect errors like when a player tries to occupy an already full field. What if a cat runs
                        across your keyboard, does your game crash? Make sure the player order is fair and nobody takes
                        two turns. Don't allow drawing outside the board.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>ERROR_INVALID_INPUT</code> must be printed if the input is not as expected<br></li>
                    <li><code>ERROR_OCCUPIED</code> must be printed if the field is already full.<br></li>
                </ol>
                <li><b>Color changing times</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Have a look at https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello_(Spiel) and make yourself familiar to the
                        game rules.
                    </li>
                    <li>If your placed stone enclose an opposing stone with one of your stones, the the opposing stone
                        is now yours.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <li>Check after every time a stone is played if the new placed stone is able to change the color of
                        an opposing stone.
                    </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Stones that just changed its color are not included in the enclosure rule. (else every
                            possible stone would be turned)
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
                <li><b>Rules… Rules… Rules…</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>The start of the game is defined by four stones in the center. Let’s start every game like
                        that.
                    </li>
                    <li>In Othello you are only allowed to put your stone in a field next to an opposing stone
                        (vertical, horizontal, diagonal), if you are able to change the color from minimum one opposing
                        stone.&nbsp;
                    </li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Check before the stone is placed, if the selected field is currently allowed.&nbsp;</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>If so, draw the stone and check for color changing events.</li>
                            <li>If not, make sure the user knows it is not allowed to put the stone there and the player
                                is able to select another field.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>Since sometimes the player is not able to play a valid turn, enable the player to “skip” the
                            turn.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the player want's to play an illegal field in terms of the rules, print&nbsp;<code>ERROR_NOT_ALLOWED</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        </li>
                        <li>If any error occurs, the previous prompt should be asked again. (In the whole game)</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
                <li><b>Winning, the Art of loosing at Loosing</b></li>
                <ol>
                    <li>If both player pass the turn (both are not able to play a valid move) or every field is set,
                        count the stones. The player with more stones on the board wins, if they are equal it’s a draw.
                        Make sure the player is informed the game is over and who has won (or if it’s a draw [both
                        players have kinda lost])

                        <li>After the two statistic lines print the game result (<code>WON_PLAYER_1</code>,&nbsp;<code>WON_PLAYER_2&nbsp;</code>or&nbsp;<code>WON_DRAW</code>)
